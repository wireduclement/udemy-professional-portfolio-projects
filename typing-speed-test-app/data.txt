Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you
Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction
It's going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible
Learning never exhausts the mind
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
Strive for progress, not perfection
The best way to predict the future is to create it
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present
Dream big and dare to fail
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Change your thoughts and you change your world
In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity
Believe you can and you're halfway there
The best way to predict your future is to create it
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary
