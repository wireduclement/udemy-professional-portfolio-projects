Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The grid is initially empty, and players take turns marking X's and O's in empty cells. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or to fill the entire grid without achieving a winning combination (resulting in a draw).

Here's a brief description of the game's mechanics:

Board: The game is played on a 3x3 grid initially empty.
Players: Two players take turns playing. One is assigned "X" and the other "O".

Gameplay:
The game starts with an empty board.
Player 1 starts by choosing a cell to mark with either "X" or "O".
Player 2 then chooses an empty cell to mark with the available option which can also be either "X" or "O" but after player 1 has chosen it's option.
Players continue taking turns until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

Winning:
A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game announces the winner and ends.

Draw:
If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game that requires strategic thinking and planning to outmaneuver the opponent and achieve victory. It's often used as a learning tool for teaching basic game theory concepts and programming logic due to its straightforward rules and mechanics.
